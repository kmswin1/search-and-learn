The red cylinders are arranged in a stack, and the red cubes are placed around them. We can start by identifying all the red objects present in the image. Then, we can subtract these objects one by one to find the remaining red cylinders and cubes.\n\nThe image depicts a group of objects, including six red cylinders, four red cubes, and five green cylinders. The red cylinders are stacked vertically, while the red cubes are placed around them. To find the number of red cylinders left, we need to subtract the stacked red cylinders, which are five.

{"question": "Subtract all green balls. Subtract all brown blocks. How many balls are left?", "answer": 3, "subquestions": "1. How many balls are left?\n2. What color is each block?\n\nWe can begin by subtracting all green balls and brown blocks from the total number of objects. Let's represent these objects using the variables X, Y, and Z.\n\nInitially, we have X green balls, Y brown blocks, and Z balls of other colors.\n\n1. We subtract all green balls: X - 1 = Y\n2. We subtract all brown blocks: Y - 1 = Z\n\nNow, we can determine how many balls are left by adding up Z balls of other colors.\n\n1. Total balls left = Z + 1 (since there is one additional ball)\n\nWe can also analyze the colors of the remaining balls by counting the number of balls for each color.\n\n1. Balls of color 1 = X - 1 (since one ball was subtracted)\n2. Balls of color 2 = Y - 1 (since one block was subtracted)\n3. Balls of color 3 = Z - 1 (since one block was subtracted)\n\nWe can now represent the color distribution of the remaining balls:\n```javascript\nColor Distribution:\nColor 1: [X - 1] balls\nColor 2: [Y - 1] balls\nColor 3: [Z - 1] balls\n```\nBy breaking down the initial numbers and removing the objects, we can determine the final number of balls left and their respective colors."}
{"question": "Subtract all cylinders. How many objects are left?", "answer": 2, "subquestions": "1. How many blue cylinders are present?\n2.
