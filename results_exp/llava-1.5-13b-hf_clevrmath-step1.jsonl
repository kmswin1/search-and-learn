There are three metallic balls: one gold, one blue, and one red. The rest are non-metallic. Since we need to subtract the metallic balls, we start with the total number of balls and subtract three:\n\nTotal number of balls - 3 metallic balls = 5 - 3 = 2\n\n1.

{"question": "Subtract all spheres. How many objects are left?", "answer": 6, "subquestions": "1. Count the number of spheres.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to first identify the spheres in the image. The spheres are the objects that have a distinctively round shape, and they are of different sizes. In this case, there are five spheres. Now, we can proceed to the next sub-question.\n\n2. Subtract the spheres.\n\nTo subtract the spheres, we need to determine the total number of objects without the spheres. Since there are five spheres, we must subtract the number of spheres from the total number of objects. Let's start by counting the non-spherical objects.\n\n1. Count the number of non-spherical objects.\n\nThere are a total of 14 objects in the image. Now, we can proceed to the next sub-question.\n\n2. Count the number of non-spherical objects that are cubes or cylinders.\n\nTo count the number of non-spherical cubes or cylinders, we can focus on the objects that have a distinctively rectangular or cylindrical shape. In the image, there are nine such objects.\n\n3. Count the number of non-spherical objects that are not cubes or cylinders.\n\nTo count the number of non-spherical objects that are not cubes or cylinders, we can look for any other shapes that do not fit into the categories of spheres or rectangular/cylindrical objects. There are four such objects.\n\n4. Subtract the spheres, cubes, cylinders, and other objects.\n\nTo find the final number of objects after subtracting the spheres, we can add up the number of objects that we identified in the previous sub-questions:\n\nNumber of non-spherical objects = 9 (cubes and cylinders) + 4 (other shapes) = 13\n\nSo, there are 13 non-spherical objects left after subtracting the five spheres."}
